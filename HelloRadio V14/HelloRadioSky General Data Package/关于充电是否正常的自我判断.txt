关于充电是否正常的自我判断：
1.系统开机状态，将USB充电头插入遥控器底部的充电口，注意观察屏幕右上角的电池图标旁会出现一个充电小图标。
2.注意1 如果不出现这个图标，说明充电器插入异常，可以换一个充电器试试。
3.注意2 如果闪烁说明充电异常，可能需要换一个充电器试试，注意如果出现这种状态，可能你需要换不同种类的充电器试一下，目前发现有的充电器适配不是很好，如果都不行你就需要联系我们旺旺小二为你处理，最终一定能为你解决问题。
4.按TELE按键进入传感器菜单，注意观察第四项应该显示的 Charge Current值，应该大于0.5A才对，最大充电功率约在10W。
5.注意：充电器只支持5V/1A/2A

Self judgment on whether charging is normal:

1. When the system is turned on, insert the USB charging head into the charging port at the bottom of the remote control, and observe that a charging icon will appear next to the battery icon in the upper right corner of the screen.

2. Note 1: If this icon does not appear, it indicates that the charger is inserted abnormally. You can try replacing the charger.

3. Note 2: If it flashes, it indicates abnormal charging, and you may need to try a different charger. Note that if this condition occurs, you may need to try a different type of charger. Currently, it has been found that some chargers do not fit well. If none of them work, you need to contact our Wangwang assistant for assistance, and we will definitely solve the problem for you in the end.

4. Press the TELE button to enter the sensor menu, and pay attention to the Charge Current value that should be displayed in the fourth item. It should be greater than 0.5A, and the maximum charging power is about 10W.

5.Note: The charger only supports 5V/1A/2A
